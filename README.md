whitesmith's was a compiler vendor that built a early portable C compiler
that was a bit on the expensive side, but ran on CP/M for 8080.

notably, for my purpose, it was the compiler for the Morrow Designs
Micronix system, a unix version 6 clone that ran on the company's
Excellent and Advanced MPZ80-based Decision 1 machines.

As I am attempting to resurrect the systems with very fragmented
binary and source resources, I have added support to Ghidra for
the whitesmith's binary format, and intend to further enhance the
support to untangle the quirky compiler conventions to regenerate
some usable source code.
